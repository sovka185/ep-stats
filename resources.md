Following are selected lists of publications that influenced us the most in making ep-stats design decisions and development.
The most important being [Ron Kohavi, Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Trustworthy-Online-Controlled-Experiments-Practical/dp/1108724264) that we used for inspiration on soft topics like how to build experimentation culture and protocol and as a checklist to make sure we haven't forgot anything in implementation.
